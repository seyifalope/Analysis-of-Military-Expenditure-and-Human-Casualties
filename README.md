# Analysis of military spending and human casualties
The main aim of this project is to extract insights and  build a dashboard using Python

This project analyzed military spending and human casualties resulting from war across different regions of the world from 1960 to 2021. The study found that military expenditure has been increasing in all regions, with a significant spike in 2010. North America was identified as the highest spender on military, followed by Europe and East Asia.


The Middle East & North Africa region had the most conflicts during the period, with Asia & Oceania having the highest number of deaths, followed by Africa. Although regions with higher military spending tended to have fewer casualties, conflicts still resulted in significant human casualties.
